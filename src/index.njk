    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Brian lives in Chanhassen, Minnesota but hails from Manitowoc, where it was always cooler by the lake and is now a fantastic ice-breaker at parties. He has four boys that keep him bald. He does a little of everything. Sometimes thatâ€™s called being a unicorn ðŸ¦„, duck ðŸ¦†, or a jack-of-all-trades ðŸ§°, but he likes to land on the Seussical-formâ€”Sneelock of the Circus ðŸŽª!</p>
