      My brief book about <a href="/hubs/opensource/" target="_blank">the open source movement</a>!<br/>
      <blockquote>
        <em>
        “I've written this book as a new entry in the compendium of open source thought. I don't fancy myself a thought-leader and for that we are all fortunate. But it is informed by years of success and failure working with open source software. The advice is honest; the vision bold; the mandate modest.”
