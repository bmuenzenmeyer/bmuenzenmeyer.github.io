The draft is "done!"
It feels good to say that. I finished late (early) one night, the final exhale of a marathon a year in the writing and a career in the making.

My [shitty first draft](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/shitty-first-drafts "‌") is now a sprawling chronicle of things said and not said. I've challenged much of what I thought I knew on this subject. I've confronted platitudes and pedestals. I've found deficiencies sitting right out in the open that more people should care about. I look forward to sharing more about these things.

Speaking of, I have more to say, and not enough manuscript yet to say it. This is a healthy but stressful moment for me. I must cut to get under word count. I knew that on the home-stretch, but now it stares back at me, a number that must go down. Each word a weight. Each phrase a promise. Each paragraph a problem. My editors gave me simple heading exercise that revealed a bloated chapter 4 that is _double_ the size of any other chapter.

So I must rebalance, rethinking an outline that I wrote a year ago. The organic growth that came out of it is probably natural. The editing process is likewise natural. I'll commit to [killing my darlings](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings "‌"), and grafting what remains for the good of the manuscript. Let's hope I can scalpel with patience. My tendency is more toward the chainsaw.
