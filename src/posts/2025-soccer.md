Growing up, I played rec soccer, high school, and then more rec. The best moments were playing indoor with Jim. Professional soccer was 3 hours away in Chicago.

Now, we are 20 minutes from watching our adopted home team, MNUFC. Let's go, you Loons!
Here's a running playlist of games we've been to as a family and with friends.

Notable moments:

- Freezing with Jim while it snows for the opener
- Ben: "The hotdogs give you the best burps."
- Jack in the locker room as a pitch pal!
- Watching Messi score, and then beating him 4-1.
- Jack gifting our new neighbor a jersey during his first game.
