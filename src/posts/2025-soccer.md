Growing up, I played rec soccer, high school, and then more rec. The best moments were playing indoor with Jim. Professional soccer was 3 hours away in Chicago.

Now, we are 20 minutes from watching our adopted home team, MNUFC. Let's go, you Loons!
Here's a running playlist of games we've been to as a family and with friends.

Jack and I also [ranked all the MLS team crests](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/posts/2025-mls-team-crest-rankings/) if you are into that sort of thing.

## Highlights

### The Messi Game
