Wow. That's one tool, right? No, wait. How could it? No objective truth could come from such short a statement. Maybe if it was a longer statement:

The right tool is the one that , that is fastest, that is cheapest, you have with you, that doesn't break, that is performant, that you can afford, that is open sourced, that never regresses, that gets the job done, that has the most buzz, that evolves over time, that is "battle-tested," that triages its issues, that can be taken apart, that is easy to replace, that is easy to maintain, that patches dependencies, that generates excitement, that continuously releases, that has the largest community, that accepts contributions, that is easy to keep clean, that has form and function, that everyone else is using, that doesn't require gloves, that has clear documentation, that is simple to start with, that properly follows semver, that works within constraints, that you are permitted to use, that can go with you anywhere, that makes callouses worth it, that has clear warning labels, that has the most GitHub stars, that has the boldest marketing, that you will have for a while, that has strong code of conduct, that has been around a long time, that requires the least training, that keeps end user goals in mind, that has a sustainable funding model, that needs the least configuration, that has the best customer service, that your buddy over there used once, with a plan for internationalization, that clearly states its prerequisites, that adapts to unexpected user demands, that helps you when you make a mistake, that is built with extensibility in mind, that entices you to use it for everything, that is most accessible to potential users, that the gatekeepers agree is most correct, that passed thorough quality assurance testing, that can be duct taped back together in a pinch, that helps tasks be accomplished "the right way," that applies the proper amount of force on its environment, that communicates with clarity and does not patronize new users, that can be upgraded from version to version with minimal retooling, that has affordances to make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing, that has comprehensive test coverage encompassing unit, integration, and functional suites, that has type definitions so users can confidently interact with the API during development, and that automates code quality formatting and linting so there is no question what expectations are from outside contributors.

So much better!

I've managed to say everything and nothing. This is a masterful amount of "it depends" bullshit only a senior engineer could dare speak. I can make assessments that confirm, overlap, contradict, stray, refute, support, or sabotage my central argument. We cannot approach absolute truth here, in my opinion, because life is just damned more complicated than that. And it's easy to get caught up in the tweet of the moment, or the deep-dive blog post throwing down The Facts, or the hyped conference, or what aquihire happened yesterday... but it's all exhausting, and it feels like local optimization. We're all makers who care about our craft and and our tools and the things we build with them. We hope to never lose sight that these tools serve a purpose beyond the making.

I don't have to know which is the right tool.<br/>
I need to know how to find out.
