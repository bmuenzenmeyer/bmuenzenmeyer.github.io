📰 Saturday News Drop!

📓 New post: [Open Source Pace Layers](https://approachableopensource.com/blog/2025-open-source-pace-layers/), now live on the approachableopensource.com blog!

🎙️ This idea percolated from a short conversation with Marty Henderson, into a [Node.js-specific blog post](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/posts/2024-do-i-need-this-node-dependency/), to a cozy [Minnestar/Minnebar](https://minnestar.org/) talk, to a great [JavaScriptMN](https://javascriptmn.com/) meetup night, and finally a full-stage [OpenJS Foundation JSConf](https://youtu.be/hRxSvDbvnaI?si=hZh7XLem5rP1cktJ) talk last month. It was only proper to give this the long-form treatment it deserves.

✨ This post complements the ideas of [Chapter One of Approachable Open Source](https://approachableopensource.com/read/principles_and_promise/) - providing a bit of thematic oomph as you start your reading journey. I've "illuminated" the text with a link directly too it. A first iteration of transforming the text into a truly perennial resource that will outlast any print run.

🆓 To celebrate this new post, I've also released [Chapter 3: Consuming Open Source Software](https://approachableopensource.com/read/consuming_open_source_software/). I learned today that some of the backtick formatting was lost on epub to HTML conversion, so I'll be working to fix that. But it remains a good coffee read and resource nonetheless. Find this in the comments, as well as the source code.

💸 Lastly, I've lowered the print, ebook, and bundle price of the book to [get it into more hands](https://approachableopensource.com/shop/). For those outside of shipping zone, there are some print on demand options now on the site too. If you are interested in supporting me and my work, and think that you, your team, someone just starting their professional journey, your AI-powered dog... anyone!, needs a copy, check it out.

Okay, go make today a good one, and look for more illuminations soon!
