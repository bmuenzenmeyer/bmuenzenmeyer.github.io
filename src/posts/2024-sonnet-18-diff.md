```diff
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
- Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
+ Thou code more lovely and more temperate.
- Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
+ Rough diffs do shake the reviews to dismay,
- And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
+ And day’s release hath all too short a date.

- Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
+ Sometime too hotfix our team semver shines,
- And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
+ And often is the MAJOR meaning dimmed;
- And every fair from fair sometime declines,
+ And every PATCH from PATCH sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;

- But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
+ But thy eternal source shall node fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
- Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
+ Nor shall bugs bring thou issue log betrayed,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.

- So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
+ So long as source open we seek to see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
