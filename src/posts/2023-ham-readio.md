If the Twitter exodus yielded any good (aside from further outing Batman as a terrible role model), it's that we should control our content and our message as if it were a resource worth preserving. I've been excited to see folks blogging again. Not only blogging, but [call-and-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_and_response_(music) "‌") blogging with one another.

## Call and Response

Here are two examples:

- Chris Coyier writes [The Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/ "‌") in January 2019
- Zach Leatherman reflects on it 4 years later within [JAVASCRIPT, COMMUNITY](https://www.zachleat.com/web/javascript-community/ "‌")
- Chris revisits his themes within [The Great Divide Was Indeed Divisive](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/12/the-great-divide-was-indeed-divisive/ "‌")
- Jeremy Keith reframes it all thoughtfully within [Chain of tools](https://adactio.com/journal/19839 "‌"), adding more context

and also:

- Dave Rupert writes [So you want to make a new JS framework](https://daverupert.com/2023/01/so-you-want-to-make-a-new-js-framework/ "‌")
- Chris dives a bit deeper via[ What does it take to make a JavaScript framework?](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/20/what-does-it-take-to-make-a-javascript-framework/ "‌")

The second chain ain't as long, but I can time travel to make it longer, because it links directly to thoughts Salma Alam-Naylor has had earlier with [Should I write a new JavaScript framework?](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/should-i-write-a-new-javascript-framework/ "‌") and updated herself via [I changed my mind about writing new JavaScript frameworks](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/write-a-new-javascript-framework/ "‌"). I find a lot of value in these conversations. I am grateful for those that spend the time to put them to paper rather than on blast within brittle social media.

## Ham Readio with RSS

RSS and the linkability of `H T M L` are helping me keep up to date on these messages. It's easy to miss a single node on a busy week, but a durable network of folks talking with one another can withstand entropy. The short-burst messaging of these blogs is nice too. Only a couple of paragraphs in some cases, but enough to articulate a thought in a novel context. Something I can consume with coffee or between meetings (or during meetings).

Let's all invest in ourselves, each other, and the ham readio economy.
