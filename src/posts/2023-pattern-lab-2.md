Hey there. Along with [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost "‌") and [Dave Olsen](https://twitter.com/dmolsen "‌"), I help build [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io "‌"). We just finished a [great workshop at WebDesignDay](webdesignday.com/atomic-design-workshop.html "‌") and want to tell you more about it.

Go read about it on Smashing Magazine: [Making and Maintaining Atomic Design Systems with Pattern Lab 2](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/ "‌"). There's plenty of info there about what's new & how to get up and running.

We can't wait to see what you build with Pattern Lab!
