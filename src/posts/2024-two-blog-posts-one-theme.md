Dropping two links here for posterity. It's been a busy week!

> I was published on Target's tech blog outlining our new Open Source Fund. It was a major career highlight to see this grow and come to light.

[https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign)

> I wrote about the gargantuan open source effort that went into redesigning https://nodejs.org. There's always more than meets the eye, and it was fun to slow down, tune out outrage salesmen reacting to this, and tell a story.
