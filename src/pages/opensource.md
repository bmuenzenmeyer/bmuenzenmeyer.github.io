## 15 Years of Open Source Experience

I believe that participation in open source as a movement takes all of us working in whatever capacity we can. There are a lot of avenues to engage, and I've occupied roles as user, contributor, reviewer, maintainer, and mentor during my career. We are part of something larger than our current issue, project, role, or company.

## Timeline

It's the contributions, large and small, sustained and one-time, that add up to more. I share some of my work here as a chronicle of this spectrum of engagement.
