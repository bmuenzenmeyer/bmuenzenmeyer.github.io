### Month in Review
This marks my second month of [tracking goals](https://github.com/bmuenzenmeyer/personal-goals) using [Una Kravets'](https://twitter.com/una) open-source goal tracking process.

<em class="emphasis">And wow what I month it turned out to be.</em>

Pattern Lab Node is being used at Target to create some crazy cool ambitious initiatives, and the team invited me to headquarters in Minneapolis to see for myself. I cannot begin to describe how rewarding the day was, and how generous my hosts were. It was truly humbling (read: terrifying)  to see _teams of people_ using that thing I wrote in the basement - really still in the shadow of the behemoth that is Pattern Lab PHP (seriously, watch out for v2). I need to do a formal write-up about this trip, as these few thoughts don't do the day, the team, or the learning justice.

On the heels of this trip came this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OH MAN I AM SO EXCITED. <a href="https://twitter.com/dmolsen">@dmolsen</a> and I are doing a full-day workshop all about Pattern Lab at <a href="https://twitter.com/WebDesignDay">@WebDesignDay</a>. Come! <a href="https://t.co/8kiVLwoOlo">https://t.co/8kiVLwoOlo</a></p>&mdash; Brad Frost (@brad_frost) <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/695237958627098624">February 4, 2016</a></blockquote>

A jealous reply on my part quickly turned into the very real possibility of me tag-teaming the workshop with Brad and Dave, completing the three-legged-stool that is Pattern Lab. Brad and Dave are nice enough to accommodate me and work with the organizers to make it all happen. Needless to say, I am looking forward to this.

I released three versions of Pattern Lab Node - something that I don't think has every happened before. The momentum and teamwork being focused on the repository right now is again humbling to be a part of. More to write on this too someday.

On the other-goals-besides-patternlab front, I spent some time getting back to design, both for myself and clients. Nothing too special, but one result was a bolder version of [www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com](www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com). It's not perfect - but it felt good to stretch out the muscles again.

I learned that I am not too great at long-sustained or vague tasks like clearing out my Instapaperâ€”filler work that is inevitably and eagerly put off. A place to tweak goals in the future into more-concrete territory, like reading `N` articles from the content list.
