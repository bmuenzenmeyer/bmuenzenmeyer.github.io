### Month in Review
The first month of [Una Kravets'](https://twitter.com/una) open-source goal tracking. I think I did alright for myself - chief accomplishments being way more reading than I have in ages. I transferred a lot of wasted time surfing reddit or whatever in favor of reading - and even lost myself a few nights reading instead of coding - an imbalance I haven't reveled in since highschool.

There were some things I didn't get done - like getting my [atom autocomplete plugin](https://github.com/bmuenzenmeyer/autocomplete-patternlab) fully functional, but this was mostly at the expense of learning more about the atom plugin architecture (my goal in the first place), and getting [Pattern Lab Node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) 1.1.0 ready for prep. As Una stated, not getting something isn't worth dwelling on - so I'm not going to.

I enjoyed month one and am looking forward to February!
