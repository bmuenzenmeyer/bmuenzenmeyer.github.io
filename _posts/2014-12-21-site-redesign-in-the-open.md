It's time for another reboot of [brianmuenzenmeyer.com](http://brianmuenzenmeyer.com).

I put a lot of time into the current tumblr site - especially in crafting the masthead. But I find it limiting, and reactionary, crafted from one idea with little creative room to grow. It was essentially a one-off idea, not an identity I want to associate myself with or build a brand on. There was no system backing the concept, or allowing a cohesive vision to be designed, iterated on, or maintained. 

So it's time to start over - and this time to [do it in the open](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/). What comes will be a reflective exercise in branding, atomic design, and process. Along the way I will try to share insights, challenges, and little tips along the way. I encourage a discussion.

My goals include:

* Creating a development environment that is maintainable, flexible, and simple to blog and experiment on top of.
* Establishing a design system that build upon core principles and is representative of me across differing contexts.
* Making a performant, mobile-first web-presence
* Creating a hub for all things I care about

As for now, the site it rather bare-bones - but intentionally so. We'll probably start with a description of the development environment. Stay tuned!
