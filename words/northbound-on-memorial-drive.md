The snow has been frequent, simple and plain,<br/>
(some shades of white are lost to comparison)<br/>
but of late, drifts so swiftly east across<br/>
the road, my gaze follows to swollen lake.<br/>
Inside, horrors don’t stir nor wake above <br/>
surface, yet south I’m sure lingers dead ships.<br/>
But what a sight remains of old complaints,<br/>
water and air formulating escape!<br/>
And both so cold, I know not which more steamed.<br/>
Thank God, reason, or just a man of taste,<br/>
that I in warm comfort witness all this,<br/>
because, the wind, very breath of the west,<br/>
casts out forgotten flames in clouds, in veils,<br/>
east where they will be new bright days for some.<br/>
It is not elapsed east that drives men west,<br/>
that direction is the last life alive.<br/>
Then I, behind snowplows gathering drifts,<br/>
turn left into the city.
