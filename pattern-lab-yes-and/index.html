  <blockquote>A Thank You</blockquote>
  <p>By now the news of some changes to the core team of Pattern Lab is <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/whats-next-for-pattern-lab/">making the rounds</a>. The Node version of Pattern Lab is forging ahead with increasing momentum from the community and an inspiring roadmap. I welcome a renewed partnership from the PHP platform. We already have some slick shared features planned. While I am excited for the future, I want to take a moment to thank the person responsible for much of my growth in the past few years, <a href="https://twitter.com/dmolsen">Dave Olsen</a>.</p>
<p>Dave, you might not realize it, but I've learned a lot from you.</p>
<p>From you I learned to adhere to a higher degree of professionalism in the code I wrote and documented.</p>
<p>From you I learned to fret over the upgrade paths my users may encounter should they remain vested in my work.</p>
<p>From you I learned how to be prepared for a release, and how to properly communicate change.</p>
<p>From you I learned to embrace the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>From you I learned to sometimes do the simple thing when the clever one seems like a better option.</p>
<p>From you I learned to be firm to an ideal, balancing developer ergonomics for user convenience.</p>
<p>From you I learned to care about people just learning something I had achieved mastery over.</p>
<p>From you I learned how to long term plan an open source project - even if things don't always go as planned.</p>
<p>From you I learned how to be a team player, playing midfield and running the length of the field to help wherever needed.</p>
<p>From you I learned to support my fellow contributor when they ask for help, for s/he is likely going through just as much bullshit as I am, and STILL choosing to contribute.</p>
<p>From you I learned that you always take a phone call if you can afford to.</p>
<p>From you I learned to separate disparate concerns at an architectural level I had not yet seen put to practice.</p>
<p>From you I learned to think beyond myself, my immediate concerns, and embrace the ideas of those around me. Without your early support, I would have achieved nothing. You are the embodiment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and..."><strong>yes, and</strong></a>.</p>
<p>From you I learned what it means to even have users that care about a product I helped build. Making is a core human endeavor. And you helped me get better at the craft.</p>
<p>Thank you Dave.</p>
